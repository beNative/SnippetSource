# SnippetSource

SnippetSource lets you organise your favorite pieces of code, scripts, thoughts, notes or other documents in a user definable tree structure. Everything is stored in a portable SQLite database.

It shares the editor module which is also used in my [Notepas](https://github.com/beNative/Notepas) project.
